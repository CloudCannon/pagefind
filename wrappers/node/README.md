# Pagefind Static Search

Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your usersâ€™ bandwidth as possible, and without hosting any infrastructure.

The full documentation on using Pagefind can be found at https://pagefind.app/.

This packages houses a wrapper for running the precompiled Pagefind binary, and also serves as a NodeJS indexing library that can be integrated into existing tools.

## Running Pagefind through NPX

This is the recommended way of running Pagefind on a static site.

```bash
npx pagefind --site "public"
```

For more details on using the Pagefind binary, see [Installing and running Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/docs/installation/#running-via-npx), and the rest of the Pagefind documentation.

## Using Pagefind as a Node library

This package also provides an interface to the Pagefind binary directly as a package you can import.

```js
import * as pagefind from "pagefind";

// Create a Pagefind search index to work with
const { index } = await pagefind.createIndex();

// Index all HTML files in a directory
await index.addDirectory({
    path: "public"
});

// Add extra content
await index.addCustomRecord({
    url: "/resume.pdf",
    content: "Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur",
    language: "en",
});

// Get the index files in-memory
const { files } = await index.getFiles();

// Or, write the index to disk
await index.writeFiles({
    outputPath: "public/pagefind"
});
```
