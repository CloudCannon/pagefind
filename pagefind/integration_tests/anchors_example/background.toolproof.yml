          <h1>Installing and running Pagefind</h1>
          <p>Pagefind is a static binary with no dynamic dependencies, so in most cases will be simple to install and run. Pagefind is currently supported on Windows, macOS, and x86-64 Linux distributions.</p>

          <h2 id="running-via-npx">Running via npx</h2>
          <p>Pagefind publishes a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pagefind">wrapper package through npm</a>, which is the easiest way to get started. This package will download the correct <a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/releases">binary of the latest release</a> from GitHub for your platform and run it.</p>
          <p>Specific versions can be run by passing a version tag.</p>
          <p>Running Pagefind via npx will download the <code class="inline">pagefind_extended</code> release, which includes specialized support for indexing Chinese and Japanese pages.</p>

          <p>If you prefer to install the tool yourself, you can download a <a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/releases">precompiled release from GitHub</a> and run the binary directly.</p>
          <p>We publish two releases, with one being extended. The extended release is a larger binary, but includes specialized support for indexing Chinese and Japanese pages.</p>
