Pagefind provides a playground page that can be used to take a deeper look into how Pagefind searches your content.
You can explore the playground for this documentation site at [/pagefind/playground/](/pagefind/playground/).

Use the playground to:
- Determine the ideal ranking parameters to configure for your content.
- Debug any issues with how your content is being searched.
- Explore all data returned from Pagefind for your content.

The playground is always available at `/pagefind/playground/` when running Pagefind with the [serve](/docs/config-options/#serve) option, e.g. with `--serve` via the Pagefind CLI.

Setting the [write playground](/docs/config-options/#write-playground) option when indexing will write the playground files to your bundle, allowing them to be hosted as part of your site.
